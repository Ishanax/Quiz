# Quiz Application

This is a quiz application that uses the Open Trivia API for questions.
It currently only uses 5 questions on the topic of computer science, but it's built to work with any amounth of questions or topic. 
Furthermore, it saves your high score in the local storage. So you can play again and maybe do better!

I've used media queries to make it responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop.
At last I made a dynamic background and a dynamic loader in CSS.
